                My concept-album - <b>Steal My Crown</b> - tells the story of a person struggling with his inner demons, 
                while trying to find out who they want to be. The reason why I went with this theme is because of 
                relatability. As a lot of people know, the plot takes place in a fictional kingdom. 
                This kingdom is actually the mind of the main character themself, hence the name 
                <b>Steal My Crown</b> - you, the listener, will have to rule that kingdom - the main 
                charater's mind - to actively feel what was felt, as if it happened to yourself.
                The reasoning behind this way of displaying the struggles is simply to show one 
                optional path out of many. If the listener shares struggles with the main character,
                it may help them, or at least increase insight to the problem(s).

                I started learning the piano in 2011. After a few years I found an interest in composing.
                I startet creating tiny individual instrumental pieces for piano in 2016, and eventually 
                it scaled up to composing songs with lyrics. The first complete song I wrote was <b>The Echo</b>, 
                and it's the 4th song on the record. The inspiration for that song actually came from an english 
                assignment in school. When creating the song, I saw the story-like potential it had, and I 
                proceeded to write the story for the concept-album. Then I wrote the rest of the songs, 
                and after it was finished, all I could do was wait. And PR, of course. I am currently writing 
                on more songs for my upcoming album, inbetween doing shows.
